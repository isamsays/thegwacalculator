    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Maintaining a competitive <strong>GWA</strong> requires more than just hard work—it demands smart strategies, consistent effort, and effective planning.  
      In this guide, we provide actionable tips to improve your GWA, enhance your study habits, and maximize your academic performance.  
      If you’re unsure how to calculate your GWA first, see our <a href="how-to-calculate-gwa.html">How to Calculate GWA</a> guide.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Understand Your Current GWA</h2>
    <p>
      Before improving your GWA, know your baseline. Review past semesters, identify high and low grades, and calculate your cumulative GWA.  
      Use our <a href="index.html#calculator">GWA Calculator Tool</a> for accurate computation.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Prioritize High-Unit Subjects</h2>
    <p>
      Subjects with more units have a bigger impact on your GWA.  
      Example: Improving a grade in a 4-unit course affects your GWA more than a 2-unit course.  
      Focus your efforts on these high-impact subjects.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Plan Your Semester Strategically</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Balance difficult subjects with lighter ones to manage workload effectively.</li>
      <li>Use a semester schedule to allocate study time and avoid cramming.</li>
      <li>Incorporate breaks and revision sessions to retain information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Improve Study Techniques</h2>
    <p>
      Effective study habits are essential. Consider:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Active recall and spaced repetition for better memory retention.</li>
      <li>Group studies for difficult subjects to discuss and clarify doubts.</li>
      <li>Consistent note-taking and review of lecture materials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Seek Help When Needed</h2>
    <p>
      Don’t hesitate to ask professors or tutors for guidance. Attending review sessions or seeking additional resources can clarify complex topics.  
      If you struggled in a previous semester, consider retaking or auditing the course to boost your GWA.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Time Management and Organization</h2>
    <p>
      Manage your time effectively:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create weekly schedules and prioritize tasks.</li>
      <li>Track deadlines, exams, and assignments to prevent last-minute stress.</li>
      <li>Use productivity tools or planners for consistency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Monitor and Track Your Progress</h2>
    <p>
      Regularly recalculate your GWA after each semester or grading period.  
      Compare your performance with your target GWA and adjust study habits as needed.  
      See our <a href="importance-of-gwa.html">Importance of GWA</a> page to understand why tracking is crucial.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Stay Healthy and Balanced</h2>
    <p>
      Academic performance isn’t only about studying. Adequate sleep, exercise, and proper nutrition improve focus, memory, and energy levels.  
      Avoid burnout by balancing academic and personal life.
    </p>

    <h2>Case Studies: Applying These Tips</h2>
    <h3>Case 1: Student Improving from 2.0 to 1.6 GWA</h3>
    <p>
      John used these strategies: prioritizing high-unit courses, adopting active recall, and tracking performance weekly.  
      Over two semesters, his GWA improved from 2.0 to 1.6, making him eligible for a scholarship.
    </p>

    <h3>Case 2: Consistency Leads to Dean's List</h3>
    <p>
      Maria applied time management, attended tutoring sessions, and reviewed past exams.  
      Her GWA remained below 1.5 across all semesters, earning her Dean's List recognition.
    </p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p><strong>Q1:</strong> Can I improve GWA after one semester?<br>
      Yes, by focusing on high-unit subjects and improving grades in future courses.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Q2:</strong> Should I retake failed courses?<br>
      Retaking low grades can significantly impact GWA, but consult your school’s policy.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Q3:</strong> How do I balance multiple subjects effectively?<br>
      Plan your semester strategically, allocate study hours, and avoid overloading difficult courses in a single term.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Q4:</strong> Are study groups effective?<br>
      Yes, discussing topics with peers helps clarify doubts and reinforces learning.
    </p>
