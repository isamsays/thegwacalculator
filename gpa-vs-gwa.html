<h1>GPA vs GWA: Comprehensive Comparison Guide (2025)</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re a student, you’ve probably heard the terms <strong>GPA (Grade Point Average)</strong> and <strong>GWA (General Weighted Average)</strong>. 
      At first glance, they may seem similar, but they are not identical. 
      Both serve as measures of academic performance, but they are used in different contexts and calculated differently. 
      Understanding the distinction between GPA and GWA can make a big difference when applying for scholarships, job opportunities, or international education.
    </p>
    <p>
      This guide provides a detailed breakdown of <strong>GPA vs GWA</strong>: their formulas, differences, applications, pros and cons, conversion guides, and real-world impact.  
      For a broader overview, see our complete guide on <a href="https://thegwacalculator.netlify.app/">GWA Calculator</a>.

    <h2>What is GPA?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>GPA (Grade Point Average)</strong> is the standard grading system used in many countries, including the United States, Canada, and parts of Asia. 
      It represents the average grade of a student across all courses, typically measured on a <strong>4.0 scale</strong>. 
      Students aiming to improve their GPA often benefit from strategies like those in our <a href="tips-to-improve-gwa.html">Tips to Improve GWA</a> guide, since the same study habits apply.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>GPA = Total Grade Points Earned ÷ Total Units Taken</code></p>
    <p>Example: Math (3 units) – A (4.0), Science (4 units) – B (3.0), English (3 units) – A (4.0)<br>
    GPA = ( (3×4.0) + (4×3.0) + (3×4.0) ) ÷ 10 = 3.6</p>

    <h2>What is GWA?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>GWA (General Weighted Average)</strong> is the grading system commonly used in the Philippines. 
      Unlike GPA, which uses a 4.0 scale, GWA is usually measured on a <strong>5.0 scale</strong> where <strong>1.0 is the highest</strong>. 
      If you want to compute yours manually, check our step-by-step <a href="how-to-calculate-gwa.html">How to Calculate GWA</a> guide.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>GWA = Σ(Grade × Units) ÷ Σ(Units)</code></p>
    <p>Example: Math (3 units) – 1.25, Science (4 units) – 1.75, English (3 units) – 1.50<br>
    GWA = ( (3×1.25) + (4×1.75) + (3×1.50) ) ÷ 10 = 1.55</p>

    <h2>Why the Difference Matters</h2>
    <p>
      For students in the Philippines, GWA is crucial for scholarships and academic honors. 
      However, when applying abroad, most schools and employers ask for a GPA. 
      This distinction is also explored in our article on the <a href="importance-of-gwa.html">Importance of GWA in Academic and Career Success</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Converting GWA to GPA (and Vice Versa)</h2>
    <p>
      Since many international applications require a GPA, Filipino students often need to convert their GWA.  
      Instead of doing it manually, you can use our <a href="https://thegwacalculator.netlify.app/">GWA Calculator Tool</a> to simplify the process.
    </p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <h3>Case 1: Applying for a Local Scholarship</h3>
    <p>
      Maria, a college sophomore in the Philippines, has a GWA of 1.4. She applies for a Department of Science and Technology (DOST) scholarship, which requires a GWA of 1.75 or better. 
      Maria qualifies easily because the system recognizes GWA directly.
    </p>

    <h3>Case 2: Applying to a U.S. University</h3>
    <p>
      John, a graduating student, has a GWA of 1.75. When applying to a U.S. graduate school, he is asked for a GPA. He uses his school’s conversion chart, which translates his GWA into a GPA of 3.5. 
      This qualifies him for admission.
    </p>

    <h2>FAQs: GPA vs GWA</h2>
    <p><strong>Q1:</strong> Which is more important — GPA or GWA?<br>
    Both are important. GPA is recognized internationally, while GWA is commonly used in the Philippines for scholarships and honors.</p>

    <p><strong>Q2:</strong> Do employers check GPA or GWA?<br>
    Local companies in the Philippines often check GWA, while international employers and schools usually prefer GPA.</p>

    <p><strong>Q3:</strong> Can I convert GWA to GPA?<br>
    Yes, but conversion varies by institution. Many universities provide equivalency tables. Roughly, a 1.0 GWA is close to a 4.0 GPA.</p>

    <p><strong>Q4:</strong> Is a 1.5 GWA good?<br>
    Yes. A 1.5 GWA is considered excellent in the Philippines and is roughly equivalent to a GPA of 3.5 in the U.S. system.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Both GPA and GWA are important depending on your academic goals.  
      If you’re aiming locally, focus on maintaining a competitive GWA.
