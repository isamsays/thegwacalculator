    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Your <strong>General Weighted Average (GWA)</strong> is more than just a number—it reflects your academic performance, discipline, and consistency throughout your college or university journey.  
      Understanding the importance of GWA helps you make strategic decisions for scholarships, academic honors, career opportunities, and further studies.  
      For an overview of how GWA interacts with GPA and international grading systems, see our <a href="gpa-vs-gwa.html">GPA vs GWA</a> page.
    </p>

    <h2>Why GWA Matters in the Philippines</h2>
    <p>
      In the Philippines, GWA is widely used by universities, government agencies, and private organizations to evaluate students. Some key areas where GWA is crucial include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scholarships:</strong> Most academic scholarships set a minimum GWA requirement (e.g., 1.75 or 1.5 for top-tier awards).</li>
      <li><strong>Academic Honors:</strong> Deans List, honors, and recognition often depend on your GWA.</li>
      <li><strong>Graduate School Admissions:</strong> GWA may influence acceptance or grant eligibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Employment Opportunities:</strong> Certain employers require your transcript, where GWA is highlighted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How GWA Reflects Academic Performance</h2>
    <p>
      A low GWA indicates high grades across subjects, while a higher GWA suggests some lower grades. For example:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>GWA</th>
        <th>Performance</th>
        <th>Possible Outcome</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1.0 – 1.25</td>
        <td>Excellent</td>
        <td>Scholarships, Dean's List, high employability</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1.5 – 1.75</td>
        <td>Very Good</td>
        <td>Eligible for most scholarships, academic recognition</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2.0 – 2.5</td>
        <td>Good</td>
        <td>Average academic standing, limited honors</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3.0 – 5.0</td>
        <td>Needs Improvement</td>
        <td>At risk of probation or remedial programs</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Case Studies: Real Student Scenarios</h2>
    <h3>Case 1: Scholarship Eligibility</h3>
    <p>
      Liza maintains a GWA of 1.45. She applies for a local government scholarship, which requires a GWA of 1.5 or better.  
      Her consistently high grades allow her to qualify without additional exams.
    </p>

    <h3>Case 2: Academic Recognition</h3>
    <p>
      Marco finishes his semester with a GWA of 1.2. His university awards him with a Dean's List recognition and a certificate of excellence.  
      This boosts his resume and increases opportunities for graduate programs.
    </p>

    <h3>Case 3: Employment Considerations</h3>
    <p>
      Karen is graduating and applies for a competitive multinational company. Her transcript highlights a GWA of 1.55.  
      Although the company primarily evaluates skills and experience, her strong GWA demonstrates diligence and consistency.
