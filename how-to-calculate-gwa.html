      <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">How to Calculate GWA — Step-by-step Guide for Philippine Students</h1>

      <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
        The <strong>General Weighted Average (GWA)</strong> is a central academic metric used by many Philippine universities to summarize a student's performance.
        If you've studied using a 4.0 GPA scale (common in some foreign institutions) or a 5.0 scale, converting to a local GWA helps when applying to local programs,
        scholarships, or checking honors eligibility. This guide walks you through reliable methods, worked examples, scholarship cutoffs, and practical tips to improve your GWA.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-6 font-semibold">Understanding the scales</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        There are two common grading scales you will encounter:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
        <li><strong>4.0 GPA scale</strong> — widely used internationally; higher numbers are better (4.0 = top).</li>
        <li><strong>5.0 GWA scale</strong> — commonly used in the Philippines; lower numbers are better (1.0 = top; 5.0 = fail).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-6 font-semibold">The simple linear formula (quick method)</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        For quick conversions, we recommend a <em>linear mapping</em> that keeps relative distances between grades consistent. The formulas used by our <a href="./index.html" class="underline">GWA Calculator</a> are:
      </p>
      <pre class="bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-800 p-3 rounded">For 4.0 scale: GWA = (5.0 - GPA) × (5.0 ÷ 4.0)
For 5.0 scale: GWA = (5.0 - GPA)</pre>

      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        The multiplier <code>5.0 ÷ 4.0</code> = <strong>1.25</strong> rescales the 4.0 range to match the span of the 5.0 range so that the top of each scale maps to the top of the other.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-6 font-semibold">Worked examples (step-by-step)</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed"><strong>Example 1 — 4.0 scale:</strong> GPA = 3.5</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li>Subtract from 5.0: <code>5.0 - 3.5 = 1.5</code></li>
        <li>Multiply by 1.25: <code>1.5 × 1.25 = 1.875</code></li>
        <li>Result: <strong>GWA = 1.875</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <p class="leading-relaxed"><strong>Example 2 — 5.0 scale:</strong> GPA = 4.5</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li>Subtract from 5.0: <code>5.0 - 4.5 = 0.5</code></li>
        <li>Result: <strong>GWA = 0.5</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="mt-6 font-semibold">Rounding & presentation</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        When presenting your GWA in applications, round to two or three decimal places depending on the receiver's preference. For example, 1.875 → 1.88 (two decimals) or keep 1.875 if exact representation is preferred.
        Always follow the instructions on application forms—some institutions have strict rules about rounding.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-6 font-semibold">Scholarship cutoffs & what counts as 'good'</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        Scholarship committees and honors boards often use GWA cutoffs. While these vary, common reference points are:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
        <li><strong>1.0 – 1.25:</strong> Outstanding — likely to qualify for top scholarships and highest honors.</li>
        <li><strong>1.26 – 1.75:</strong> Very strong — qualifies for many scholarships and dean's lists.</li>
        <li><strong>1.76 – 2.5:</strong> Good — passing and satisfactory for many programs.</li>
        <li><strong>> 3.0:</strong> Below typical scholarship cutoffs — review required.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-6 font-semibold">Tips to improve your GWA (practical, semester-focused)</h2>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mt-2">
        <li><strong>Prioritize high-unit courses:</strong> A strong grade in a 6-unit course moves your weighted average more than a 1-unit course. Focus study time accordingly.</li>
        <li><strong>Attend office hours:</strong> Clarify expectations and grading rubrics with instructors to avoid surprises.</li>
        <li><strong>Re-check calculations:</strong> After grades post, confirm your semester average arithmetic—small mistakes add up.</li>
        <li><strong>Plan strategically:</strong> If you need to hit a cutoff next semester, calculate target grades per course using our <a href="./index.html" class="underline">calculator</a> to reverse-engineer the required marks.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="mt-6 font-semibold">Common mistakes & edge cases</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Assuming all schools use the same conversion:</strong> They don't. Some universities use percentile or manually adjusted conversions. Always verify with the target institution.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Not weighting by units:</strong> Some students compute a simple average instead of a weighted average, which can misrepresent the true GWA if units differ by course.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-6 font-semibold">When to verify with the registrar</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        Use this guide and the <a href="./index.html" class="underline">GWA Calculator</a> for quick checks. If you're applying for formal recognition (transfer, scholarship, degree honors), request an official conversion or transcript evaluation from the registrar or admissions office — that will be the final authority.
